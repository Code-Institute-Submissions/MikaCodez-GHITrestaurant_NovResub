## UX
### Users
The user should be able to interact with the website freely and be able to visit the menu, book and reserve a table with a date/time of their choice. They will be able to also Sign up and login with an authenticated account that allows them to interact with their booking and write about their dietary requirements such as allergies etc.

### Purpose
The Application is designed as a restaurant website which will be the first introduction to the user of what they can expect to find and enjoy their restaurant experience. The site provides an idea of the dishes available, the location of the restaurant and allows the user to be able to Manage their booking and reservation.
